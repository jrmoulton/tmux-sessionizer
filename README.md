# tmux-sessionizer (tms)

The fastest way to manage projects as tmux sessions

## What is tmux-sessionizer?

Tmux Sessionizer is a tmux session manager that is based on ThePrimeagen's
[tmux-sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/bin/tmux-sessionizer)
but is opinionated and personalized to my specific tmux workflow. And it's awesome. Git worktrees
are automatically opened as new windows, specific directories can be excluded, a default session can
be set, killing a session jumps you to a default, and it is a goal to handle more edge case
scenarios. 

Tmux has keybindings built-in to allow you to switch between sessions. By default these are `leader-(` and `leader-)`

Switching between windows is done by default with `leader-p` and `leader-n`

## Notes

I use the `tms sessions` command to get a tmux styled output of the running session and I use that
output on the bottom right of my tmux status bar. E.g. ![tmux status bar](images/tmux-status-bar.png)
If there is an easier way to do this someone please tell me.
